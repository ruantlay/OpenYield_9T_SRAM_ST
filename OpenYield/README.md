# OpenYield: An Open-Source SRAM Yield Analysis and Optimization Benchmark Suite
![](img/logo-cut-openyield.jpg)
**OpenYield** is a novel and scalable SRAM circuit generator designed to produce diverse, industrially-relevant test cases. It distinguishes itself by incorporating critical second-order effects often overlooked in simpler SRAM models, such as:

* **Detailed Parasitics:** Accurate modeling of parasitic capacitances and resistances.
* **Inter-cell Leakage Coupling:** Accounting for leakage current interactions between adjacent memory cells.
* **Peripheral Circuit Variations:** Modeling variations in the behavior of peripheral circuits like sense amplifiers and write drivers.

This enhanced level of detail enables more realistic and reliable yield analysis of SRAM designs.

## Key Features

* **Xyce Integration:** Utilizes the Xyce parallel circuit simulator for transistor-level simulations.
* **Monte Carlo Simulation Support:**
    * Built-in Monte Carlo simulations within Xyce.
    * Support for user-defined Monte Carlo simulations, allowing for custom process parameter generation.
* **Performance Metrics Analysis:** Evaluates critical SRAM performance metrics:
    * Hold Static Noise Margin (SNM)
    * Read Static Noise Margin (SNM)
    * Write Static Noise Margin (SNM)
    * Read Delay
    * Write Delay
* **Output Parsing and Waveform Plotting:** Includes parsers to extract simulation results and tools to visualize signal waveforms.
* **Extensible Design:** The project is under active development with plans to integrate various yield analysis and sizing optimization algorithms.

## Dependencies
* **[FreePDK45](https://eda.ncsu.edu/freepdk/freepdk45/):** Required by SRAM circuit generator and Xyce simulator.

* **[PySpice](https://pyspice.fabrice-salvaire.fr/releases/v1.4/overview.html):** Required by SRAM circuit generator. Install using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install PySpice
    ```
    
* **[Xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov/about-xyce/):** A SPICE simulator for fast simulation. Install using conda through vlsida channel (built for [OpenRAM](https://github.com/VLSIDA/OpenRAM.git)):

    ```bash
    conda install -q -y -c vlsida-eda trilinos
    conda install -q -y -c vlsida-eda xyce
    ```
    For building your own Xyce please refers to this [guide](https://xyce.sandia.gov/documentation-tutorials/building-guide/)

## Usage Examples
The `main.py` contains the usage examples.

### 0.  Conda Environment  Creation
create the conda environment from our `yml` file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
If you success, then activate the env
```bash
conda activate openyield
```
otherwise, check the environment and update it
```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml
```


### 1.  Using the `Testbench` Class
Define some PDK related parameters.
```python
vdd = 1.0 # Supply voltage
# your pdk_path is `'model_lib/models.spice'` by default 
pdk_path = 'model_lib/models.spice' 
# Mos model name for NMOS and PMOS
nmos_model_name = 'NMOS_VTG'
pmos_model_name = 'PMOS_VTG'
```

The `Sram6TCoreMcTestbench` class in `testbenches/sram_6t_core_MC_testbench.py` facilitates Monte Carlo simulations of the SRAM core. Here's a basic example of how to instantiate and use it:

```python
from testbenches.sram_6t_core_MC_testbench import Sram6TCoreMcTestbench

# Create an instance of the testbench
mc_testbench = Sram6TCoreMcTestbench(
    vdd,
    pdk_path, nmos_model_name, pmos_model_name,
    num_rows=num_rows, num_cols=num_cols, 
    w_rc=True, # Add RC to nets
)
```

### 2. Using the `run_mc_simulation` Method
The `run_mc_simulation` method within the `SRAM_6T_Array_MC_Testbench` class executes Monte Carlo simulations.  Here's an example demonstrating its usage:

```python 
# Continue with instantiation of Sram6TCoreMcTestbench
# Define the number of Monte Carlo samples
num_samples = 10

# Run the Monte Carlo simulation
# For using DC analysis, operation can be 'write_snm' 'hold_snm' 'read_snm'
read_snm = mc_testbench.run_mc_simulation(
    operation='write_snm', 
    target_row=num_rows-1, target_col=num_cols-1, 
    mc_runs=num_mc, vars=None, # Input your data table
)

# For using TRAN analysis, operation can be 'write' or 'read'
w_delay, w_pavg = mc_testbench.run_mc_simulation(
    operation='write', 
    target_row=num_rows-1, target_col=num_cols-1, 
    mc_runs=num_mc, vars=None, # Input your data table
)
```

### 3. Using the Optimization Algorithms

OpenYield includes integrated SRAM circuit optimization algorithms that can be accessed after running Monte Carlo simulations.

#### Available Algorithms

* **PSO** - Particle Swarm Optimization
* **SA** - Simulated Annealing  
* **CBO** - Constrained Bayesian Optimization
* **RoSE-Opt** - Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Bayesian Optimization
* **SMAC** - Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration



### 4. Using the SRAM Yield Estimation Alogrithms

OpenYield provides integrated SRAM yield estimation algorithms based on Monte Carlo and advanced importance sampling techniques. These algorithms help quantify failure probability under process variations with high efficiency and accuracy.

#### Available Algorithms
- **MC** ：Monte Carlo
- **MNIS** ： Mean-shifted Importance Sampling
- **ACS** : Adaptive Compressed Sampling
- **AIS** : Adaptive Importance Sampling
- **HSCS**: High-dimensional Sparse Compressed Sampling

#### Usage

Run the main script which includes the optimization module:

```python
python main2.py
```

After the Monte Carlo simulation completes, you'll be prompted to select optimization algorithms:

```
Select optimization algorithm(s) to run:
  Enter number(s) separated by commas (e.g., 1,3,5)
  Enter 'all' to run all algorithms
  Enter 'none' to skip optimization
```

#### Output

Results are saved in:
* `sim/opt/results/` - Optimization results and statistics
* `sim/opt/plots/` - Convergence plots and visualizations

## Important Notes:

* Ensure that you have Xyce installed and configured correctly. OpenYield assumes Xyce is available in your system's PATH.
* The netlist parameter should point to the SPICE netlist file describing your SRAM cell.
* The structure of the mc_results will depend on the specific analyses performed in the Monte Carlo simulation. You'll need to inspect the output to understand how to access the desired metrics.
* Refer to main.py for more complete examples and usage patterns.

## Future Development
This project is actively being developed.  Planned future enhancements include:
* Integration of advanced yield analysis algorithms.
* Implementation of SRAM cell sizing optimization techniques.
